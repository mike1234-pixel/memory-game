# Memory Game

1. the game is single-player and runs on one browser client, multiple players can be supported by playing a hot-seat game (taking turns in the same web app)
2. the web app should use a set of random images for memory cards fetched from CAT API
• registration and API key not needed (the service works free as well)
• if you're not into cats that much, you can use any service you like, but it needs to be an online service with a REST api
3. the game presents the cards in a rectangular layout, where the memory game can be played according to classic memory game rules 
4. the app tracks the current and end result somehow
